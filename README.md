# Ana's Explainability Toolkit ðŸ”Ž

A collection of methods to i) interpret deep neural network states (the `decode` folder) and ii) act on these interpretations (the `act` folder). 

All methods rely on a model format similar to a HuggingFaceðŸ¤— model with the option to `output_hidden_states = True` to output the intermediate states and `output_attentions=True` to output attention maps.

The `notebooks` folder contains notebooks that show examples of how the methods can be used.
