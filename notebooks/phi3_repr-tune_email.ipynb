    "\n",
    "A widely used use-case of LLMs is to help you write emails. However, if I just go and ask ChatGPT to write an email to my boss to reschedule a meeting, it'll answer me in a very generic style. I'd like to have my own style in the message. We'd like to achieve this without using prompts and explore alternatives that can implicitly extract a user's style preference based on other emails they wrote. \n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to tailor to a specific style is to finetune the model with a parameter-efficient approach such as LoRA. This requires updating 100s of thousands of parameters (while a lot less than full fine-tuning, it's still a lot) on potentially thousands samples. And once obtained, we'd need to store an adapter per user (each of which will be 100s of thousands of parameters). Since we may have only a few examples of note styles and want to be memory efficient at inference time, we do not consider this approach here. \n",
    "\n",
    "A much cheaper approach would be to simply pass in the note examples in the context window (a few-shot prompt) and rely on the model's in-context learning abilities to adapt the style. Alternative methods would leverage the semantically meaningful *internal* structure. While steering vectors have had success in adjusting the output to specific styles and require only a handful of examples, in the case of more fine-grained structure with a larger diversity in semantics, they did not work well. Hence, I consider a different approach: a finetuning method on the level of representations inspired by the approaches in https://openreview.net/pdf?id=nZeVKeeFYf9, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15179 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03592."
